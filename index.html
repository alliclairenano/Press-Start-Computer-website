		<p class="text">I'm Alliere, the creator of the webpage. A gamer and a beginner in programming. Making this page is really important especially for those who love playing games. About this page, old games and indie games are created but for now, there are two games here. There is the difference of playing old and indie from the modern games- the gameplay, mechanics and graphics. But everything is challenging and fun. What matter the most is that having fun with friends and learning how not to give up and continue the game. Making a strategy to win and level up in the game makes it more amazing. Old and indie should not be understimated because the games might be tricky. That's what the games are for.</p>
